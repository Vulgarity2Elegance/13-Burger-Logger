## Description

![screenshot](./assets/screenshot.png)

A burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

Please visit [heroku](https://yozi-burger-logger-13.herokuapp.com/) and try it yourself.

## Usage

-   Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

-   Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

-   Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

-   Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
